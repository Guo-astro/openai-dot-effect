# Dot Effect Processor

A React-based image processing application that applies a "dot effect" to images. It supports both static images and animated GIFs (using [gifuct-js](https://github.com/matt-way/gifuct-js) for decoding).

## Features

- **Drag & Drop / File Upload:** Easily load an image or GIF by dragging and dropping or browsing.
- **Dot Effect Processing:** Adjust settings such as block size, maximum dot radius, spacing, and brightness threshold to customize the dot effect.
- **GIF Support:** Animated GIFs are processed frame-by-frame to render the dot effect animation.
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Dark/Light Background Toggle:** Choose a background that best suits your image processing style.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Guo-astro/openai-dot-effect
   cd openai-dot-effect
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install

   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your development environment).

## Usage

1. **Load an Image:**
   - Drag and drop an image or GIF into the designated area, or click the **browse** button to select a file.

2. **Customize Settings:**
   - Adjust the dot effect settings (block size, max dot radius, spacing, brightness threshold) using the input fields and sliders.
   - Toggle the dark background if desired.

3. **View the Result:**
   - The processed image (or animated GIF) will be displayed in the preview panel with the applied dot effect.

## Dependencies

- **React & TypeScript:** For building the UI.
- **gifuct-js:** For decoding GIF files ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/matt-way/gifuct-js)).
